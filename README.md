# Maven_super_shop_sales_Dashboard

In my latest project, I focused on using data analysis to help businesses succeed by accurately predicting sales and gaining valuable insights. 📊
Here's what I achieved:
🎯 I found the most important indicators to measure how well stores are doing.
🎨 I created a cool dashboard with pictures and buttons so that people can easily look at and play with the data. This helps us understand things better.
📈 I used past sales data to guess how much we might sell in the next 15 days.
These findings have really helped make smart decisions, grow the supermarket, and make customers happier. hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#SalesForecasting hashtag#BusinessSuccess
